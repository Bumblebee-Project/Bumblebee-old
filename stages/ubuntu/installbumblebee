# Before you start with messing with symlinks or removing files, make sure
# that you know what you are doing. Examine the installation scripts of
# nvidia-current and libgl1-mesa-glx to get an idea how the alternatives
# system should be used. If you're using rm or ln in /etc/alternatives, you
# are doing it wrong.
# A helpful command for showing links being created on configuring an other
# alternative:     update-alternatives --display gl_conf

# Since Bumblebee is a project to get Optimus laptops to work, we can safely
# assume that the nvidia driver is not used for the default display (:0)
# Therefore default to mesa instead of nvidia. vglrun sets the GL library
# path to /usr/lib{,32}/nvidia-current for programs running on the display
# accelerated by the nvidia card. Since most graphical applications are not
# statically linked nor setuid/setgid binaries, this is fine. There is an
# exception on this: programs which overwrite LD_LIBRARY_PATH will fail to
# load the nvidia GL driver. However, this method will allow GL on the Intel
# display where the previous situation breaks it.
# TLDR: this allows the intel display to use GL, the bumblebee display will
#       load the nvidia driver through vglrun in almost all cases

# this takes care of setting correct links which is used on
# /usr/lib/nvidia-current/gl.conf
# multiarch support
for arch in x86_64-linux-gnu i386-linux-gnu; do
	# check if the link exist to prevent error messages
