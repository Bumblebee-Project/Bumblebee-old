#
# Xservers file, workstation prototype
#
# This file should contain an entry to start the server on the
# local display; if you have more than one display (not screen),
# you can add entries to the list (one per line).  If you also
# have some X terminals connected which do not support XDMCP,
# you can add them here as well.  Each X terminal line should
# look like:
#	XTerminalName:0 foreign
#
# When adding X servers, please keep the following things in mind:
# - If the X server's number is not zero, it must be passed to the X
#   server's command line as its first argument.
# - When using the Xorg X server, it is wise to add the vtXX
#   option to each local X server, since this is the only sure way
#   of knowing in advance which X server attaches to which virtual
#   console.
# - SECURITY NOTE: Always pass the "-nolisten tcp" option to the X
#   server, as shown in the examples below, unless you know you
#   need the X server listening on a TCP port.  Omitting this
#   option can expose your X server to attacks from remote hosts.
#   Note also that SSH's X11 port-forwarding option works even with
#   X servers that do not listen on a TCP port, so you do not need
#   to remove the "-nolisten tcp" option for SSH's benefit.
# - See the Xserver(1) manpage for a description of X server
#   options.  If you are using the Xorg X server, see the
#   Xorg(1) manpage for a description of options specific to it
#   (such as "-depth").
#
# Examples for multiple local X displays:
# :0 local /usr/bin/X :0 vt9 -depth 15 -nolisten tcp -tst
# :1 local /usr/bin/X :1 vt10 -depth 8 -nolisten tcp -tst
:1 local /usr/local/bin/optimusXserver -ac -config /etc/X11/xorg.conf.nvidia -sharevts -modulepath /etc/alternatives/xorg_extra_modules-bumblebee,/usr/lib/xorg/modules -nolisten tcp -noreset :1 vt9
