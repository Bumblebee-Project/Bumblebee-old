IMPORTANT:

Ubuntu Users:

sudo bumblebee-uninstall
sudo apt-get install ppa-purge
sudo ppa-purge ppa:ubuntu-x-swat/x-updates
sudo ppa-purge ppa:xorg-edgers/ppa

The Installation should now be completely automatic...

First of all: If you have any problem... please create a bug report package
with the bumblebee-bugreport tool..

Then create an issue on github...

This project have had great succes and I need to have a way to easily manage
support problems..


Now 3D is enabled on both the Intel and the nVidia at the same time..

The Intel card is running the Desktop and the nVidia card can be used for
the thougher applications with the command "optirun32 <application>" or
"optirun64 <application>"...

So now we just need somebody to write an application for automatically
balance which applications should be run on which card.. 

Support for automatically shutting down and starting up the nVidia card is
in developpement.

There are several ways to start using bumblebee:

Download the .zip or .tar.gz by clicking the 'Downloads' button on the
'Source' page to a directory of your liking. Unzip or untar and run the install
script with 'sudo ./install.sh' (or 'sudo -E ./install.sh' on Fedora)

Go to the directory of your liking and:
1. git clone http://github.com/MrMEEE/bumblebee.git
2. cd bumblebee/
3. sudo ./install.sh (or 'sudo -E ./install.sh' on Fedora)

(The second method makes it easier to regularly update bumblebee if you're
willing to invest a little bit of time in working with git.)

I left the old releases up there in the old/ folder.. if someone needs it..
