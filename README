!!! WORK IN PROGRESS !!!

The previous master branch was unstable, hence it was removed.
If you're feeling adventurous, you can try our release-2.3 branch which is
available at https://github.com/Bumblebee-Project/Bumblebee/tree/release-2.3

The below shell commands retrieves the latest 2.3 candidate, removes the broken
Bumblebee from MrMEEE/bumblebee and ppa:mj-casalogic/bumblebee and installs
Bumblebee:

    git clone git://github.com/Bumblebee-Project/Bumblebee.git -b release-2.3 --depth 1
    cd Bumblebee
    sudo ./cleanup
    sudo ./install

Cheers,
The Bumblebee Team
