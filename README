## About Bumblebee

Bumblebee aims to provide support for nVidia Optimus laptops for GNU/Linux
distributions. Using Bumblebee, you can use your nVidia card for rendering
graphics which will be displayed using the Intel card.

Note that you cannot disable the Intel GPU even with Bumblebee installed.

Support for enabling and disabling the the nVidia card is in development.

Currently, Bumblebee has only been tested on Ubuntu, Arch Linux and openSuSE.
Please join #bumblebee on Freenode if you wish to help testing and creating
the installer.
