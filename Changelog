-----------------------------------------
Release version 2.3.0 (stable) changelog
-----------------------------------------

    - Complete rewrite of Bumblebee:
        - Automatically detect the right settings without bumblebee-configuration
        - Offline configuration is possible now which speeds up configuring
        - Temporary removed power management as it may make the system unstable.
          See https://github.com/Bumblebee-Project/Bumblebee/wiki/ACPI-Removed
        - Drop sudo and make a daemon start the X server on request
        - Automatically detect whether 32-bit or 64-bit libraries are needed,
          dropping the need for the -32 option on optirun
        - Add --help options to install, optirun (client) and bumblebee (daemon)
        - Fully unattended installer available using the --unattended option
        - Bumblebee can now be packaged more easily using installer options
        - New uninstaller which just stops the bumblebee daemon and removes its
          own files. Dependencies are not removed.
        - Trimmed xorg.conf allowing the system to autodetect settings
        - Separate cleanup script which takes care of fixing GL and removing
          versions prior to 2.3
        - Cleaned up the code, syntax errors do not occur anymore on exceptions
        - Removed VGL_READBACK option as this setting should not be changed. It
          can still be set as environment variable if needed
        - Removed VGL_LOG as it is rarely needed to change. It's also more
          flexible to change it using the --debug-log option of optirun
        - Errors are logged to /var/log/bumblebee.log
        - Better error handling if X fails to start or the driver(s) fail to
          (un)load
        - Fallback setting to configure starting
        - Improved bugreport tool
        - Improved X security by enabling host-based authentication
        - Unified, distro-independent files for initscript (a.k.a. handler) and
          optirun
