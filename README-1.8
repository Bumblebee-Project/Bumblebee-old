This is Bumblebee 1.8, our effort to bring Optimus support to GNU/Linux 
Operative Systems.

With Bumblebee, 3D is enabled on both the Intel and the nVidia cards at the same time.

The Intel card is running the Desktop and the nVidia card can be used for
the thougher applications with the command "optirun <application>".

Support for automatically shutting down and starting up the nVidia card is
in developpement.

Currently, Bumblebee has only been tested on Ubuntu and Arch Linux. Please join
#bumblebee on Freenode if you wish to help testing and creating the installer.

First of all: If you have any problem, please create a bug report package
with the bumblebee-bugreport tool.

Then create an issue on GitHub.

This project have had great succes and we need to have a way to easily manage
support problems.

There are several ways to start using bumblebee :

Using your package manager (best way) :

Ubuntu :
1. sudo add-apt-repository ppa:bumblebee/stable

If you want newer drivers than the one available in your distro repo, then do :
1bis. sudo add-apt-repository ppa:x-swat/update

2. sudo apt-get update
3. sudo apt-get install bumblebee

Arch Linux :

Or by a script install :

Download the .zip or .tar.gz by clicking the 'Downloads' button on the
'Source' page to a directory of your liking. Unzip or untar and run the install
script with 'sudo ./install.sh'

Go to the directory of your liking and:
1. git clone http://github.com/Bumblebee-Project/bumblebee.git
2. cd bumblebee/
3. sudo ./install

(The second of this two script methods makes it easier to regularly update bumblebee
if you're willing to invest a little bit of time in working with git.)

Users who want to test the development code should run:

    git clone git://github.com/Bumblebee-Project/Bumblebee.git -b develop --depth 1
    cd Bumblebee
    sudo ./cleanup
    sudo ./install
