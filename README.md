Are you looking for Bumblebee for supporting your Optimus hardware on Linux?
We've moved!

## http://Bumblebee-Project.org

Because we have fully rewritten the Bumblebee concept in C, we decided to start
in a new repository. The bash version from the 2.4.x series has been superseded
by the C version which can be found on http://Bumblebee-Project.org/. This
repository is kept for historical reasons. **Please report issues on
http://Bumblebee-Project/issues** and not here!
